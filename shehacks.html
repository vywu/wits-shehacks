          <div class = "question">
            I don't know how to code. Can I still come?
          </div>
          <div class = "answer">
            Of course! The event is designed for first-time hackers to try something new. We actively encourage people from all backgrounds, disciplines, and majors to attend! We have workshops that’ll teach you everything you need to know. Just bring yourself, a willingness to learn, and a positive attitude!
          </div>
          <div class = "question">
            Can I attend with no prior hackathon experience?
          </div>
          <div class = "answer">
            YES! Over 60% of our attendees last year were first-time hackers!        
          </div>
          <div class = "question">
              Do I need to come with a team?
          </div>
          <div class = "answer">
            You can come solo or with a team - whichever you like. If you already have a team (up to 5 people), you can register with them. If you don't have a team but would like one, we can match you up with one before the event, or you can form your own the morning of during breakfast and registration.

        <div class = "question">
          Is this event women-only?
        </div>
        <div class = "answer">
          Yes! As we’re focused on creating a talent pipeline from minorities in tech, this event is specifically created as a place for newcomers to explore the tech industry in a fun, relaxing, and non-competitive way. If you're in high school, university, college, or graduate school and want to break into tech, you're 100% welcome here!
        </div>
        <div class = "question">
        I'm not a girl/woman, can I still come?
      </div>
        <div class = "answer">
          SheHacks is designed to be a inclusive space to support women who are interested in technology. If you identify as a woman, you're welcome to join us!
        </div>
         <div class = "question">
        Why can’t men attend?
      </div>
      <div class = "answer">
        The tech industry is still dominated by men, which unfortunately can make the environment a toxic and unwelcoming one for women. At the Women in Tech Society, we're simply bringing women up to speed to be equals, as women are still disadvantaged in the social and political spheres.
